🔷 What is Entropy?
Entropy is a measure of impurity or disorder in a dataset.
In classification, it quantifies how mixed the classes are in a subset.
Formula:
Entropy=−∑(pi⋅log⁡2(pi))\text{Entropy} = -\sum (p_i \cdot \log_2(p_i))where pip_i is the probability of class ii.

🔷 Why Do We Calculate Entropy?
To measure how pure or impure a dataset is.
It helps in deciding where to split in decision trees using Information Gain.
Lower entropy = purer = better split.

🔷 High vs. Low Entropy
EntropyPurityMeaning
High (near 1)	Impure	Mixed class labels	
Low (near 0)	Pure	Mostly one class (good for learning)	

🔷 What Does "Impure" Mean?
A dataset is impure if it contains a mix of different classes.
Pure means almost all samples belong to one class.

🔷 Using Entropy in Decision Trees
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', random_state=42)
criterion='entropy': uses Information Gain to split nodes.
random_state=42: ensures reproducibility of results.
Builds a tree that splits the dataset to reduce entropy at each level.

🔷 Example Using Entropy (Iris Dataset)
Loaded Iris dataset.
Split data into training and test.
Trained DecisionTreeClassifier using entropy.
Evaluated accuracy.
Visualized the tree showing how splits were made.

🔷 Extra Topics Covered
Difference between 'entropy' and 'gini':
Both are used to measure impurity.
'entropy': based on information theory (log).
'gini': simpler, often faster, but similar performance.

CODE:

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load example dataset (Iris)
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split into train/test
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create Decision Tree with entropy
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}")
