 ‚úÖ **Underfitting**:

* **Definition**: The model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
* **Behavior**:

  * Performs poorly on both training and testing data.
  * **High error (sum of squared errors or SSE) on both training and testing data.**
* **Bias/Variance**:

  * **High bias**: Model makes strong assumptions and fails to capture complexity.
  * **Low variance**: Model doesn't change much with different training data.

 ‚úÖ **Overfitting**:

* **Definition**: The model is too complex and learns the noise in the training data.
* **Behavior**:

  * Performs very well on training data (low training SSE).
  * Performs poorly on testing data (high testing SSE).
* **Bias/Variance**:

  * **Low bias**: Model fits training data well.
  * **High variance**: Model is sensitive to small changes in training data.

 ‚úÖ **Bias and Variance**:

* **Bias**: Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm.

  * **Shows up in training error** (and testing too, if underfitting).
* **Variance**: Error due to the model‚Äôs sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data.

  * **Shows up mainly in testing error** (especially in overfitting).
